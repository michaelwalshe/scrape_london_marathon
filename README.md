# scrape_london_marathon
The Virgin London Marathon website provides a webpage showing the results for each year. The underlying data is not publicly available, but as there are only slight changes in the search interface each year it is possible to programmmatically scrape the tables for each year to perform data analysis on.

Currently only example_... works completely as intended, to just scrape the 2020 version of the website, other files are WIP to scrape all other years, and to improve performance by using multiprocessing.
